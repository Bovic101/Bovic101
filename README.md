I’m a full-stack software engineer currently honing my skills at Schwarz Group/42 Heilbronn, where I’m building a strong foundation in systems programming. My journey is focused on mastering full-stack development, while diving deep into machine learning at the University of Hohenheim. I aim to create software solutions that not only scale but also make a meaningful impact, with a particular interest in how technology can transform industries like animal health.

With a Master’s and Bachelor’s in Animal Science, I’ve explored how software can innovate areas such as animal health monitoring, blending my passion for technology with real-world applications.
